CINE fetal CMR at 0.55T Reconstruction with motion-correction and cardiac gating

This repository contains code to reconstruct CINE fetal CMR at 0.55T at multiple spatial resolutions. First, real-time images are reconstructed for motion-correction and cardiac gating. Fetal cardiac CINEs are then reconstructed using the corrected data. Please cite the following paper, if you are using this code:
